# Short Description

The execution of this code takes place on the Phoenix Cluster of the GT PACE network; therefore the particle swarm optimization is initilialized by `qsub bioescript109.pbs`. Simulation intialization will change depending on both OS and Cloud computing architechture (if used). Simulations will be written to the `simulations` folder and subfolders will be named by the parameters and simulation ID.
